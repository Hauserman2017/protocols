## General information

For plates, add 15 g Agar and a stir bar. Cool in the 55 °C bath prior to pouring, until the media can be touched with bare hands. Add [antibiotics](antibiotics.md) if required. Stir for approximately 1 min, then pour.

## Minimal Media

### Tris minimal medium

Mix the following:

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
50 ml  | Tris base, pH 7.5 (1M)
500 ml | [DSW (2X)](#dsw-2x)
450 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O

Filter, then add each filter-sterilized solutions:

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
1 ml   | K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (5.8%)
1 ml   | FeSO<sub>4</sub> (10 mM)
 |
to 0.2% (w/v) final | *N*-acetyl-glucosamine as N+C-source
 | or
to 0.2% (w/v) final | Carbon Source
5 ml   | NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (20%)

## General media recipes

### DSW 2X

`Defined seawater 2X`

Note: This is defined sea water for minimal media and **not for animal incubation** (for the latter use Instant Ocean). Final concentrations:
- 100 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>
- 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>
- 600 mM NaCl
- 20 mM KCl

In a 2 L beaker add 1 L dI H<sub>2</sub>O and set aside.

In three smaller beakers dissolve each of the constituent solutions as described. Ensure they are completely dissolved, then add to the beaker above.

Beaker | Reagent(s)         | Dissolve completely in
:-:|:-----------------------|:-------
1  | 49.5 g MgSO<sub>4</sub> • 7 H<sub>2</sub>O      | 250 ml dI H<sub>2</sub>O
2  | 5.75 g CaCl<sub>2</sub> • 2 H<sub>2</sub>O      | 250 ml dI H<sub>2</sub>O
3  | 70.25 g NaCl + 3 g KCl | 250 ml dI H<sub>2</sub>O

Adjust total volume to 2 L with dI H<sub>2</sub>O. Filter sterilize and store at room temperature. Lasts 1-2 months.

### Glucose (20% v/v)

In a 1 liter graduated cylinder mix:

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
200 g  | glucose
800 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O

Cover with parafilm and invert multiple times to mix.

Dispense 100 ml aliquots into milk dilution bottles.

Autoclave, store at room temperature.


### Glycerol (50% v/v)

In a 1 liter graduated cylinder mix:

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
500 ml | glycerol
500 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O

Cover with parafilm and invert multiple times to mix. Glycerol is very viscous, so make sure it mixes completely and does not stick to the container. Dispense 100 ml aliquots into milk dilution bottles and autoclave.

### Instant Ocean (70% v/v)

In a 1 liter graduated cylinder mix:

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
300 ml | dI H<sub>2</sub>O
700 ml | Dissolved Instant Ocean at approximately 33-38 ‰

Cover with parafilm and invert multiple times to mix.  Dispense 100 ml aliquots into milk dilution bottles and autoclave.

Note: Solution is not checked for salinity.  The purpose of the 70% solution is to provide a growth-unsupportive medium for dilution plating.  Solution is inappropriate for animal work.

### IPTG (100 mM)

`isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside`

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
238 mg | IPTG
10 ml  | ddH<sub>2</sub>O

Filter sterilize, then store 0.5 ml aliquots at -20 °C.

When adding to autoclaved media prior to pouring, add 1 μl IPTG solution per 1 ml agar for a final concentration of 0.1 mM.

If spreading on plate, consider that a typical plate agar volume is 25 ml. Dispense 75 μl sterile water on the plate containing 10 beads, add 25 μl IPTG to the plate, then shake to distribute evenly.

### Xgal (20 mg/ml)

`5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside`

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
200 mg | Xgal
10 ml  | *N,N*-dimethylformamide (Dispense in hood)

Mix in screw-cap glass tube, or on a small scale in a polypropylene microfuge tube.

Note that dimethylformamide dissolves some plastics (e.g., polystyrene conical tubes).

Mix well and store at -20°C.

Add 100 μl to agar plates for β-galactosidase assays.

The most uniform distribution in an agar plate is accomplished by adding Xgal to the liquid agar after the media has been autoclaved and can be touched (~60 °C), then mix well prior to plating. Alternately, if Xgal is spread on a plate directly, pipet onto multiple foci and use 10 glass beads to distribute it rapidly before it sets into local areas of the plate.

### DAP (300 mM, 1000x)

`Diaminopimelic acid`  
MW = 190.19

Amount | Reagent
------:|:-------
1.14g  | DAP
20 ml  | ddH<sub>2</sub>O

At this concentration, the DAP will not go into solution, so aliquot quickly after mixing. Autoclave. Vortex before adding to agar plates.
