# Gene Deletion in *Vibrio fischeri*

This protocol describes gene deletion in *V. fischeri* by allelic exchange.

## Clone the allelic exchange vector

1. Clone approximately 1.6 kb upstream DNA & downstream DNA. Aim for similar sized upstream and downstream fragments so that crossovers on either flanking side are equally likely.

<!-- add additional info, vectors, pictures, etc. -->

## Introduce the deletion vector to the *V. fischeri* recipient

1. [Conjugate](conjugation.md) the plasmid from *E. coli* into *V. fischeri*
  - Plate the 10 μl conjugation spot onto fresh LBS agar and incubate overnight at 25-28°C.
  - Scrape the spot into 700 μl LBS.
  - Plate 50 μl of the resuspension and 10<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-3</sup> dilutions of the resuspension onto LBS-Cam plates

## Isolate single recombinants

Isolate strains in which the allelic exchange vector has integrated at the chromosomal locus through a single crossover either at the upstream flank or the downstream flank.

1. Once single colonies appear (may take 2 days), select approximately 40 isolated colonies (transconjugants) and restreak onto LBS (no antibiotic) for single colonies (without antibiotic).  Note that you can streak >1 colony per plate. Incubate overnight at 25-28°C.

1. The next day, patch 4 colonies per transconjugant onto LBS-Cam (i.e., a total of 160 patches). Incubate overnight at 25-28°C.
  - Pro tip: patch each set of four in opposite directions to track each isolate: `/ / / / \ \ \ \ / / / /`

1.  Identify transconjugants in which 3 or 4 of the 4 patches are antibiotic resistant. **These are the single recombinants, the isolates in which the allelic exchange vector has integrated into the chromosome--and is therefore maintained even in the absence of selection**. 

1. For each transconjugant in which the plasmid has integrated, ioculate one of the chloramphenicol-resistant patches into 3 ml LBS-Cam and grow overnight at 25-28°C to prepare a -80°C freezer stock. Simultaneously inoculate 3 ml LBS to identify the double recombinants below (see next step...).

## Isolate double recombinants

Isolate a single recombinant-derived strain in which the allelic exchange vector has recombined out of the chromosomal locus through a single crossover at the opposite flank, leaving the deletion construct instead.

1. From the patch above or from the -80°C freezer stock of the single recombinant, inoculate 3 ml LBS. Grow at 25-28°C  until slightly turbid (OD<sub>600</sub> ≈ 0.2).

1. Dilute culture 1:1000 into 3 ml LBS and grow at 25-28°C until again slightly turbid.

1. Plate for single colonies on LBS (10<sup>-3</sup>, 10<sup>-4</sup>, 10<sup>-5</sup> dilutions). Incubate at 25-28°C overnight.

1. Patch single colonies onto LBS and LBS-Cam. Antibiotic sensitive mutants have likely lost the allelic exchange vector. They may be the potential double recombinant (mutant) or they may have reconstructed the wild-type strain.

1. Screen 8 potential mutants using PCR.


## Verify deletion constructs

1. Screen for:
- Absence of deletion DNA
- New junction created by the deletion
- Absence of plasmid backbone material (i.e., that you are not simply observing mutation of the cam cassette).
